Detour crate requires nightly rust.

D3D9 Hook example. Example renders an filled box.

Added imgui example.  This was hacked together to get functionality, would definitely attempt a cleaner method than this

Code could definitely use improvement, but this was a good learning exercise with the rust compiler

Note: There doesn't appear to be bindings for d3d9 fonts.  Might need to look into alternatives
